# Heleton
Minimal 2D game skeleton for Haxe Heaps engine

 ![Heleton](/heleton.png "Heleton")

Although [Heaps](https://heaps.io/) is a flexible and performant engine, it can feel a bit **DIY** in certain areas. [Heleton](https://github.com/nayata/heleton) is designed to fill in these gaps for a quicker start: it includes a scene manager with smooth transitions, automatic scene updates, an tween engine, scripts for custom resize handling, and a simple performance display panel.

**Heleton** draws some inspiration from **deepnight**’s [gameBase](https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase), but is designed to be as simple and minimalistic as possible.
